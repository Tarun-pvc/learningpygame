# gameVentures: Python- Pygame! :snake:

## A Brief description of the repository:
- This is one of my gameVentures! I'm testing out different game libraries/ engines like pygame, raylib, etc.
- In this particular repository, I will post my pygame-based games as I learn more about the library.
- I will include a README file in each game, where there will be more information about the game.
- I will update this repository as i get more game ideas and as i get more time to make them.
