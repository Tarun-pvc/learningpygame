# pygame

This repo only contains the legends of my adventures on pygame!
In this repo, there are 2 games

1. A Game that I think will turn out to be something like pacman 
2. A game that's basically a ripoff of pokemon!

* All "games" are under development!*

I wish to soon add:
-> More Sound effects
-> Actual playability
-> Levels
-> Splash menus
-> Customization!
